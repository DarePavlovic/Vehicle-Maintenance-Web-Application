This project involves the development of a web application for вехицле maintenance management within a company, designed to streamline vehicle tracking, cost monitoring, and repair logging. The system provides centralized control over fleet operations, ensuring timely maintenance and efficient resource utilization.

The application is built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and features three user roles: Administrators, Mechanics, and Drivers. Each role has distinct functionalities to facilitate smooth workflow coordination. The system enables users to log vehicle repairs, track fuel consumption, record service history, and manage expenses efficiently.

A key challenge addressed in the project was ensuring data consistency and integrity when handling repairs and defect records, which was solved using asynchronous operations and database optimization. Additionally, image storage was implemented using Base64 encoding for ease of management.

This solution enhances operational efficiency, minimizes maintenance costs, and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time vehicle management within a company’s logistics system.
